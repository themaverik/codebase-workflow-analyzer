## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. LLM "Segment Myopia" (UNRESOLVED)
Current LLM analysis misclassifies projects due to lack of project-level context understanding. The analyzer tool itself gets misclassified as a "User Management Web Application" instead of recognizing it as a "Codebase Intelligence & Development Workflow Automation Platform".

**Root Cause**: Segment-level analysis without project-level context integration
**Impact**: Reduced business domain classification accuracy
**Status**: Context management infrastructure exists but LLM integration incomplete

### 2. Framework Detection Accuracy Claims
Claims of "95%+ accuracy" are unvalidated and likely overstated based on current pattern matching coverage.

**Status**: Need benchmark validation and pattern expansion

## Development Priorities

### Immediate Priority: LLM Context Integration
- **Phase 8.1**: Integrate project-level context into LLM prompting
- **Phase 8.2**: Implement project-type-specific business domain analysis

## Next Development Phase

### Phase 8 Completion: LLM Context Integration (HIGH PRIORITY)
The critical remaining work is resolving the "segment myopia" issue by:

1. **Context-Aware LLM Prompting**: Integrate project-level context into LLM analysis
2. **Project-Type-Specific Analysis**: Use ProjectType classification to guide domain inference
3. **Hierarchical Context Injection**: Leverage existing HierarchicalContextManager for LLM enhancement
4. **Business Domain Accuracy Validation**: Benchmark and validate improved classification results

This project represents a fundamental shift from pattern-matching code analysis to AI-powered business intelligence extraction, enabling automated reverse engineering of codebases into systematic development workflows. The architecture and most components are well-implemented, with the primary remaining work being LLM context integration to achieve the target business domain classification accuracy.

## Development Roadmap

Based on comprehensive codebase analysis, here are the most critical items that need to be addressed, prioritized by impact and urgency:

### CRITICAL PRIORITY - Immediate Fixes Required

#### 1. LLM "Segment Myopia" Context Integration
**Priority: URGENT - Core Functionality Broken**
**Status**: Infrastructure exists (85% complete), needs integration
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

**Problem**: The LLM analyzes code segments without project-level context, leading to severe misclassification. The analyzer tool itself gets classified as a "User Management Web Application" instead of a "Codebase Intelligence Platform."

**Impact**: 
- Defeats the core value proposition of intelligent business domain detection
- Makes business domain classification unreliable (40% accuracy instead of target 90%+)
- Renders LLM enhancement ineffective

**Solution Path**: 
- Leverage existing `ProjectAnalyzer` (85% complete) to provide project context
- Use `HierarchicalContextManager` (80% complete) to inject context into LLM prompting
- Utilize `ProjectClassifier` with 23 project types to guide domain-specific analysis
- Integrate project-level context into business domain classification

#### 2. End-to-End Integration & Validation
**Priority: HIGH - System Reliability**
**Status**: Components exist individually, integration incomplete
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days

**Problem**: Many sophisticated components exist in isolation but aren't properly integrated or tested together.

**Impact**: 
- System may fail in production scenarios
- Unreliable results from cross-component dependencies
- Cannot trust system outputs for business decisions

**Solution Path**:
- Add integration tests for the 6-step analysis pipeline
- Validate CLI integration of all analysis components  
- Create benchmark datasets for accuracy validation
- Ensure robust error handling across component boundaries

### HIGH PRIORITY - Core Feature Enhancement

#### 3. Business Domain Intelligence Enhancement
**Priority: HIGH - Core Differentiator Incomplete**
**Status**: 40% complete, needs LLM integration
**Estimated Effort**: 4-5 days (depends on LLM fix completion)

**Problem**: Only 40% complete despite being a core product differentiator. Pattern matching is basic and LLM enhancement is not integrated.

**Solution Path**:
- Expand pattern matching sophistication in `BusinessDomainEngine`
- Integrate LLM enhancement (after fixing segment myopia)
- Add domain-specific analysis plugins
- Validate business domain classification accuracy

#### 4. Framework Detection Accuracy Validation
**Priority: MEDIUM-HIGH - Credibility Issue**
**Status**: Claims 95% accuracy without validation
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

**Problem**: Claims 95% accuracy without validation. Pattern coverage appears limited based on code analysis.

**Solution Path**:
- Benchmark against real-world projects
- Expand pattern matching coverage for additional frameworks
- Validate and correct accuracy claims
- Add support for emerging framework patterns

### MEDIUM PRIORITY - Advanced Documentation Features

#### 5. External Documentation Path Support
**Priority: MEDIUM - Enhanced Analysis Capability**
**Status**: New feature requirement
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days

**Feature**: Support for external documentation folders via CLI argument.

**Implementation Requirements**:
```bash
# Example usage
./codebase-analyzer analyze --path /project --ext-docs-path "/external/docs1,/external/docs2,./local-docs"
```

**Technical Approach**:
- Extend CLI argument parsing to support comma-separated external documentation paths
- Enhance `DocumentationExtractor` to accumulate documentation from multiple sources
- Add path resolution for relative paths (e.g., '.' for current directory)
- Implement deduplication logic to avoid analyzing the same documentation twice
- Update configuration system to support external documentation sources

**Configuration Integration**:
```yaml
documentation_analysis:
  external_documentation_paths: []
  enable_path_deduplication: true
  relative_path_base: "."
  max_external_sources: 10
```

#### 6. Cross-Repository Documentation Intelligence
**Priority: MEDIUM - Multi-Project Analysis**
**Status**: New feature requirement
**Estimated Effort**: 5-6 days

**Feature**: Intelligent identification of documentation relevant to current project from external multi-repository documentation sources.

**Use Case Scenario**:
```
my-project/
├── backend-1/           # Currently analyzing this
├── frontend-1/          
├── core-1/              
└── my-project-docs/     # External docs containing architecture for all components
```

**Implementation Requirements**:
- **Project Relationship Detection**: Analyze external documentation to identify sections relevant to current project
- **Multi-Project Context Understanding**: Extract overall project purpose and architecture from external documentation  
- **Component-Specific Analysis**: Identify detailed features and requirements for current project component
- **Contextual Documentation Filtering**: Use project name, directory structure, and content analysis to filter relevant documentation
- **Hierarchical Documentation Processing**: Support parent project documentation that describes child components

**Technical Approach**:
- Extend `DocumentationClaimsExtractor` with cross-repository analysis capabilities
- Add semantic matching between project identifiers and documentation content
- Implement documentation relevance scoring based on project context
- Create hierarchical documentation context that includes both project-specific and parent-project information
- Add configuration for multi-repository documentation patterns

**Configuration Integration**:
```yaml
cross_repository_analysis:
  enable_cross_repo_docs: true
  project_identifier_patterns:
    - "project_name"
    - "directory_name" 
    - "package_name"
  relevance_threshold: 0.6
  include_parent_project_context: true
  max_cross_repo_depth: 3
```

### DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES

All roadmap implementations must adhere to:

1. **Industry Standards**: Follow Rust and general software development best practices
2. **Security-First Design**: Comprehensive input validation and secure file handling
3. **Configuration-Driven**: No hardcoded values, full YAML configuration support
4. **Professional Architecture**: Clean abstractions, proper error handling, extensive testing
5. **Performance Considerations**: Efficient file processing, caching, and memory management
6. **Extensibility**: Plugin-ready architecture for future enhancements
